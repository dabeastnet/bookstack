# Base Nginx configuration for BookStack
#
# This configuration serves the application from the /var/www/bookstack/public
# directory and forwards PHP requests to php‑fpm via a local TCP socket.
# Only the public directory is exposed to HTTP; all other files remain
# inaccessible.  Directory listings are disabled on the uploads path
# and the usual PHP location block ensures index.php is used for all
# application routes.  Additional security headers are added to help
# mitigate common web attacks.  Adjust client_max_body_size via an
# environment variable passed at runtime (UPLOAD_LIMIT), falling back
# to 50m if not set.

# Not used if not running as root.

# Ignore files and directories not required in the final image.  This
# significantly reduces the build context size and avoids leaking
# development artefacts into the container.  Note that vendor and
# node_modules will be populated during the build process via
# Composer and any asset build step, so they can be excluded from
# copying by default.
